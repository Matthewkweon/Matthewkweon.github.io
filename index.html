            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Yongjoon Kweon, but I go by Matthew. I am a rising junior studying Computer Engineering
                at Boston University. I am interested in machine learning, software engineering, and data science. I am proficient 
                in Python, Java, and C++. I am also familiar with machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Sci-kit Learning.
                I am also proficient in web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                I am a quick learner and I am always eager to learn new things. I am a hard worker and I am always willing to go the 
                extra mile to get the job done. I'm super excited to learn more things in the future and truly believe that as long
                as I am consistent and productive, I can achieve anything I set my mind to, and I hope to share that curiosity to the world.
            </p>

                <h3>Hairolet LLC Start-up</h3>
                <p>Website link: <a href="https://hairolet.solutions/">website</a></p>
                <p>
                    This is a start-up company that my friend, Saba Fajors, harvard undergraduate, and I have created in hopes to expand the coding outreach and 
                    make it more accessible for everyone. We have started an initiative to teach coding to underprivileged students around
                    the U.S. We have made the website free to use and accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection. We have
                    co-developed python courses and are in the process of creating a similar C++ course, which I have taking the lead in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of June 17, we are currently in the midst of a rebuilding and rebranding. We want to make the website more user-friendly and 
                    target a younger generation of coders. We feel that there is a huge market for younger audiences to learn how to code as software 
                    engineering continues to grow. Wish us luck on our rebranding as we have brought on multiple new members to help us market our 
                    website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Hairolet LLC, I led web development efforts using HTML within Squarespace, managing and maintaining the startup’s 
                    website to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing online presence. This role involved overseeing over 30 engagements per 
                    month, demonstrating my ability to handle high-traffic web environments effectively. Additionally, I co-developed and provided a 
                    free comprehensive Python course, engaging over 60 students with quizzes, practice projects, and in-depth content to enhance their 
                    programming skills. My contributions extended to leading the development of a new C++ course, showcasing my expertise in diverse 
                    programming languages. Furthermore, I assisted in creating a paid version of the course, featuring advanced content and additional 
                    resources, to offer a more in-depth learning experience for students seeking advanced knowledge and skills. This experience at 
                    Hairolet LLC allowed me to blend technical proficiency with educational content creation, significantly contributing to the company’s 
                    mission of providing accessible and high-quality programming education.

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Gym Classification</h3>
                <p>Github link: <a href="https://github.com/Matthewkweon/Gym-classifier">Github</a></p>
                <p>This is a personal passion project that stems from my passion in Machine Learning, web development, API usage and the Gym.</p>
                <p>This project is targetted at users who are more unfamiliar with the gym, and to make the gym experience a more 
                    inclusive space, I create a program where users can input an image of any gym equipment and the program will 
                    output a short discription of the machine, how to use it, and also link a suitable youtube tutorial video they
                    can watch. This is designed to be easy, simple, and user friendly for all users in order to make the gym space
                    a more judgement-free zone, as everyone knows how intimidating the gym can be for beginners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed a full-stack web application using Python and JavaScript to classify gym equipment from images, 
                    leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API. The application is web-based and phone-accessible, allowing users to 
                    upload images of unfamiliar gym machines for instant identification. This feature is particularly designed 
                    to assist older gym-goers and newcomers in navigating and effectively using gym equipment by providing usage 
                    instructions and linked tutorial videos. Throughout the project, I integrated multiple APIs, including OpenAI 
                    and YouTube, and implemented image processing techniques using Pillow, demonstrating my practical machine learning 
                    and computer vision skills. Additionally, I deployed and managed a production-ready application on Heroku, 
                    incorporating error handling, logging, and security practices such as CORS management. This project enhanced my 
                    understanding of full-stack development, API integration, and deployment strategies, while also honing my skills in 
                    machine learning, computer vision, and creating user-friendly interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently in the works of expanding this outreach and after further algorithm optimization, I plan to deploy this
                    at my local gym and paste a QR code that will allow users to access this program. Wish me luck!

                <h3>Productivity Program</h3>
                <p>Github link: <a href="https://github.com/Matthewkweon/productivity-tracker">Github</a></p>
                <p>This is a personal  project stemming from my passion in productivity videos and books. Throughout my college life,
                    I have been engrossed in the world of productivity and self-improvement, and I have always wanted to create a program
                    that would help me focus when deep work was needed. This project was meant to help myself focus, but also can be used 
                    by others with basic knowledge of python, javascript and web-development. I am currently working on making this program 
                    into a desktop application, so that it has more control over the user's computer and can be used more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed a productivity tracker utilizing HTML/CSS, Python, and JavaScript, featuring a Pomodoro timer and goal-setting 
                    functionalities aimed at helping users with productivity issues. The application includes real-time activity monitoring 
                    implemented using Flask and is deployed on the Heroku infrastructure, ensuring seamless, real-time, and accessible productivity 
                    tracking. I collaborated with Pushover APIs and experimented with Twilio for notifications, integrating a responsive design that 
                    enhances user interaction and engagement. Through this project, I learned to effectively combine front-end and back-end technologies 
                    to create a cohesive and user-friendly application, while also gaining experience in deploying and managing applications on cloud 
                    platforms. The use of Pushover requires users to have the app installed for notifications, adding an extra layer of real-time 
                    communication to the productivity tracker.
